A location-based social media application designed to help users discover, filter, and interact with nearby venues. Built with Flutter for cross-platform UI, Firebase for backend services (authentication, real-time database, and media storage), and Google Places API for retrieving place information, the app offers a rich, community-oriented experience. Users can view nearby spots, add photos and reviews, follow friends, and see their activity feeds, while also customizing their profiles and preferences.
