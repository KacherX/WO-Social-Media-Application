1. Introduction:

In this project, a mobile application named WO was developed to enable users to explore nearby venues based on their real-time location while integrating social media features. The system allows filtering venues by category (e.g., restaurant, café, bar) and sorting them by proximity, popularity, or rating. Alongside venue discovery, users can upload photos, rate venues, post comments, and interact with other users through likes and friendships. The application was built using Flutter for cross-platform development, Firebase Firestore & Storage for backend services, and Google Places API for venue and photo data. One of the primary challenges during development was finding a reliable source of venue images; OpenStreetMap lacked adequate image support, prompting a transition to Google Places API. The resulting system offers a scalable and interactive platform combining geolocation with social media dynamics.
